# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event. "Advent of Code" is an annual event where two programming puzzles are published each day from 1 to 25 December. Solving these puzzles is not only great fun, but also a great opportunity to learn and improve your programming skills.

1. clone the repository to a local computer.
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Run the source file corresponding to the day.
